# Sockets-with-Java
In this repository, I show you how can you use sockets in java, send a word and, then save it in a file.
### What is a socket?
A socket is a way to send data independently of each other. This class usually is used in a client-server model.
### How to use this code?
Before that you begin with the compilation is important to mention that the file named Server.java only transforms a word to uppercase and the file named ServerFile.java also saves the word in another file named Example.txt with the date.

1. First, you need to download the code of this repository, here you found 3 files *.java*.

2. Second, open your terminal move to the directory where downloaded the repo, and type javac \*.java 

3. Third, type *java Server* or *java ServerFile* depends that you want to do, then in another terminal type *java Client* for open the client and send a message.
